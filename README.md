Code for [/u/DealWithItbot](http://www.reddit.com/user/DealWithItbot/).  

Processin' those dank reddits into may mays using Python with PRAW and OpenCV.

PyDankReddit is the backbone to a reddit bot that finds faces and eyes in images. When a pair of eyes are found within a face, a pair of "[Deal With it](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/powderblock/PyDankReddit/master/assets/glasses.png)" glasses are added.

Should add some sw33t sunglasses onto your reddits rite now m8.
